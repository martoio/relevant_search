# What is relevance?

> Ranking search content based on how much that content satisfies the needs of the user and the business.

- What sort of content?
- What sort of users?
- What type of searches?
- What are the user expectations?
- What is the company trying to get out of search?

A "relevance engineer" has to understand the content, the user, the business and the users' goals - usually this requires interaction and cooperation with multiple shareholders within the company.

There's multiple classes of search and no 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Elasticsearch/Lucene provide a search framework on which we have to build a great search UX.
