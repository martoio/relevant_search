# Let's search!

## Before search, there was data
So let's index some data in our cluster. We have some handy python scripts in our `python` folder to help with that. First, let's run `/root/tools/python/init.sh`{{execute}}
This will setup a `virtualenv`, and pull down some requirements for us.

After everything is setup, we can run `python /root/tools/python/index_files.py`
